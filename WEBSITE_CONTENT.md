5 common questions a visitor would have before signing up.

**H2:** `Common questions`

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| What types of documents does Insight work with? | PDFs, Word documents (.docx), plain text files, and spreadsheets. Support for images and scanned documents (OCR) is on the roadmap. |
| Is my data private? | Yes. Your documents are stored in your workspace and are never used to train shared AI models. Each workspace is isolated. |
| What languages does Insight support? | Questions and answers work in English and Swahili. Support for more Tanzanian languages is planned. |
| How does pay-as-you-go work? | You purchase credits in advance. Each action (indexing a document, asking a question, running an extraction) costs a small number of credits. There's no monthly fee. |
| Can I use Insight with my whole team? | Yes. You can invite colleagues to your workspace, with role-based access (admin, editor, viewer). |
