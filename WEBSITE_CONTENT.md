# Ubunifu Technologies - Website Reference

A maintenance reference for ubunifutech.com. This describes the site **as it is
actually built** - pages, where each piece of content lives, and the design
tokens in use. Edit content in the data files noted below, not in components.

## Page map

The site is multi-page. Routes:

| Route | Page | File |

Contact is a section (`#contact`) included on the Home, Products, and Work
pages rather than a standalone route.

---

## Services (`/build`)

Five service areas (defined in `src/app/build/page.tsx`): Web Development, Data
Analytics, Brand Design, AI & Automation, Digital Strategy. Followed by a
three-step process (Tell us what you need → We scope and plan → We build and
deliver) and the Portfolio showcase.

---

## Work (`/work`)

Client projects, defined in `src/content/portfolio.tsx`:

- **Safari King Africa** - safari booking platform. `safarikingafrica.com`
- **Usambara Destination** - eco-tourism website. `usambaradestination.com`

The same two clients appear as a logo strip via the `Clients` component on the
Home, Products, and About pages.

---

## About (`/about`)

Page header → values cards → team → client logos → CTA.

Values (`src/content/values.tsx`): Built for Africa from the start · No
unnecessary complexity · Pricing that matches the market · Tanzania-first,
Africa-wide.

Team (`src/content/team.tsx`):

- **Richard Pallangyo** - Data & AI Builder. AI/ML, data engineering, Python/FastAPI, product.
- **HappyGod Pallangyo** - Creative Director. Brand identity, UI/UX, visual direction, video.

Team photos are currently branded initials avatars. To use real headshots,
drop image files into `public/images/` and set the `photo` field in
`src/content/team.tsx`.

---

## Blog (`/blog`)

The listing page reads markdown files from the `_posts/` directory via
`src/lib/blog.ts`. Two posts are published:

- *Building Software for Africa: Where the Real Opportunity Is*
- *Why We Chose Pay-as-You-Go Pricing*

To add a post, create a new `.md` file in `_posts/` with frontmatter
(`title`, `date`, `author`, `excerpt`, `tags`). Draft outlines for upcoming
posts are tracked separately in `BLOG_OUTLINES.md`.

---

## Content data files

All editable content is separated from components:

| File | Controls |

## Known follow-ups

- Replace team initials avatars with real headshots.
- Replace the Portfolio "browser mockup" logo treatment with real project
  screenshots when available.
- Add real testimonials / client quotes once collected.
- Consider a standalone `/contact` page if the contact section outgrows
  being a shared section.
- Publish the blog posts outlined in `BLOG_OUTLINES.md` once the facts in
  each `[NEEDS INPUT]` marker are confirmed.
